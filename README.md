# üöÄ CUDA-Accelerated Spatial Distance Histogram  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project explores **GPU acceleration** for large-scale data analysis by computing the **Spatial Distance Histogram (SDH)** of 3D points. A na√Øve CPU implementation is compared against multiple GPU implementations to evaluate how **parallelization, memory coalescing, and shared memory** improve performance.  

Inspired by:  
*Pitaksirianan, Nouri, and Tu. "Efficient 2-Body Statistics Computation on GPUs: Parallelization & Beyond."*

## ‚ö° Key Contributions  
- Implemented **CPU baseline** and **GPU kernels** for pairwise distance computations.  
- Optimized memory layout (struct ‚Üí split x/y/z arrays) to enable **global memory coalescing**.  
- Designed two GPU approaches:  
  1. **Shared Memory Kernel** ‚Äì block-level histogram accumulation.  
  2. **Enhanced Block-Based Kernel** ‚Äì reduced global memory traffic, register caching, intra/inter-block distance computation.  
- Used **constant memory** and **atomic operations** for efficient histogram updates.

## üìä Results  
Benchmarked with datasets of **10k, 50k, 100k, and 500k points**.  

- **GPU implementations significantly outperform CPU baselines.**  
- Transition from struct-based to split-array storage improved memory throughput.  
- **Optimized GPU kernel (Alg3)** achieved the **highest speedups**, especially at scale (500k points).
